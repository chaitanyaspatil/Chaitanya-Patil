I earned my Bachelor's in Technology degree in Electronics Engineering from [Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune (VIT, Pune)](http://www.vit.edu/index.php) in May 2019.

At VIT my academic interests were:
1. Signal and Image Processing
2. Semiconductor Device Physics
3. Robotics

I have interned at two organisations: [Godrej Group](https://www.godrejconsoveyo.com/GodrejConsoveyo/index.aspx?id=362) in Mumbai and [SCI-COM Software](http://scicomsoftware.com/) in Pune for a summer and a semester-long internship respectively.

At college, I was part of the TEDxVITPune organizing team which held annual conferences under a TEDx licence. I spent my free time at college writing for and then leading my college magazine editorial board, 'Pi' as Editor-in-Chief. 

I will be pursuing an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) starting Fall 2019.
