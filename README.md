I earned my Bachelor's in Technology degree in Electronics Engineering from [Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune (VIT, Pune)](http://www.vit.edu/index.php) in May 2019.

At VIT my academic interests were:
1. Signal and Image Processing
2. Semiconductor Device Physics
3. Robotics

I have interned at two organisations: Godrej Group in Mumbai and SCI-COM Software in Pune for a summer and a semester-long internship respectively.

I spent my free time at college writing for and then leading my college magazine editorial board, 'Pi'. I was part of the TEDxVITPune organizing team.

I will be pursuing an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) starting Fall 2019.
